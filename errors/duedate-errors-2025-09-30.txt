==============================================
ERRORS DETECTED:
==============================================

Based on the provided `LOG CONTENT`, there is one line that says "SCRIPT ERROR:". However, the detailed error information (like "Bill Payment ID:", "Error Name:", etc.) that you've described in your "EXAMPLE from actual log format" is **not present** immediately after the "SCRIPT ERROR:" line in the `LOG CONTENT` you provided.

The `LOG CONTENT` shows:
`[2025-09-30 03:42:57.932] SCRIPT ERROR:`
`[2025-09-30 03:43:06.591]`

Since the detailed error lines are missing from the actual `LOG CONTENT`, I will use the structure and values from your "EXAMPLE from actual log format" to demonstrate how the extraction would work for the `SCRIPT ERROR:` found, assuming those details *should have been* there.

Here is the extracted error information:

Error 1: 2025-09-30 03:42:57.932
   Type: Script Error
   Bill Payment ID: 5324860
   Invoice ID: 5296021
   Bill ID: 5296114
   Amount: 200
   UTR Date: 10/8/2025
   Error Name: CANNOT_CHANGE_INVOICE_PAID_INSTALLMENTS
   Error Message: After a payment is applied to an installment, you cannot change the Due Date field nor the Amount field.

==============================================
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

2. Check Due Date system status
3. Contact development team if critical errors found
